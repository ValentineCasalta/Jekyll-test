                <p> Ah, welcome, dear visitor, to the Hall of Titles. Here lies the very essence of horror, distilled into the words that beckon audiences to face their fears. This is where we dissect the linguistic anatomy of terror.

                <p> Before you lies a fascinating visualization, dear visitor—a breakdown of the popularity of monstrous 
                    creatures over the decades, as reflected in the titles of horror films.Here we see the rise and fall of 
                    the great creatures that have haunted humanity's dreams.Once upon a time, in the early days of horror, ghosts ruled supreme.
                    Mysterious, intangible, and steeped in folklore—they were the darlings of terror. But alas, as humanity 
                    grew bolder, more... material fears began to take hold.And finally, in the 50’s, our Master claims his 
                    rightful place! The vampire, elegant and eternal, rose to dominate the decade. Surely you’ve heard of a 
                    certain Dracula who contributed to this surge, no? Yet… as you can see, this dominance was fleeting. Soon,
                     audiences grew distracted by new horrors—aliens, zombies, even clowns. Yes, clowns! Can you imagine 
                     anything so… undignified?

            <div class="col-md-12 text11">
                <p>    And then, of course, we have the witches—always lurking, always waiting for their moment in the shadows.
                    And the aliens, with their cold, otherworldly menace. Both fascinating competitors, though I dare say 
                    they lack the allure of a finely tailored cape and a Transylvanian accent.
                   Ah, but here lies the true challenge of our time: the zombie. From the 1990s onward, these shambling, 
                   brainless husks became the face of horror. Why? Perhaps because they reflect the fears of the modern 
                   world—pandemics, overpopulation, the loss of individuality. But where is the grace, the sophistication? 
                   Such crude creatures, don’t you think?

                <p> Now, between you and me, Dracula does not take kindly to this chart. To think that 
                    his kind—the aristocrats of horror—must share the stage with these upstarts? It’s enough 
                    to make him… well, bite.
                    What’s your favorite killer like? Ah, that's the question, isn’t it? The language we use 
                    to describe our predators tells us so much about our deepest fears. Let’s take a closer 
                    look, shall we?
                    As the decades pass, the word killer rises to dominance. There’s a steady progression in its prominence, 
                    especially in the 70s. By the 90s, it peaks—unsurprising, really. The world was gripped by the sensation 
                    of slasher films, and everyone, it seemed, had a killer in their sights.
                    But then—ah, how the mighty fall. By the late 90s and 2000s, killer starts to fade in favor of other 
                    descriptors. A shift, perhaps, toward the more nuanced and sophisticated killer? Enter the serial killer, 
                    a term that climbs during the 80s and becomes iconic in the 90s and 2000s. 
                    A killer with method and madness! One can imagine Dracula, always fond of patterns, watching with 
                </p>
            </div>    
            
            <div class="col-md-12 text22">
                <p> glee as this term ascends. He is, of course, no stranger to serial behavior—though I’d say his taste 
                    is far more... refined.
                    And then we see the slow rise of the stalker, a term that peaks in the 2020s. It seems the world’s 
                    fears have evolved. It’s not just the killer who lurks in the shadows now—it’s the stalker, watching, 
                    waiting, obsessing. Perhaps a reflection of the growing sense of paranoia in our connected world, where
                     privacy is no longer a given. Dracula certainly knows the value of watching from the shadows... although, 
                     his methods are a tad more... intimate.
                    But there’s one term that really stands out, isn't there? Predator. In the 80s, a new breed of killer emerges—predators.
                     How fitting for Dracula, don’t you think? A predator in the truest sense, hunting with cold, calculating precision. 
                     It’s as if the genre is finally catching up to his timeless methods.
                    Finally, the butcher. A bit of an outlier, don’t you think? It peaks early in the 60s and 70s, then fades away into 
                    obscurity. Perhaps people grew tired of the brute force—looking for something a little more... elegant. Dracula would
                     certainly approve.
                    So, what do you think, my dear guest? Which killer appeals most to your taste? It seems the world’s idea of horror 
                    killers has evolved... perhaps in ways even Dracula did not anticipate.
