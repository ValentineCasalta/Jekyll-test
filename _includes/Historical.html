                <p> Ah, welcome, dear guest, to this grand tour of Dracula's most cherished abode. 
                    As you may know, my master, Dracula, has dedicated countless years—centuries, in 
                    fact—to the study of human fears and the evolution of horror films. His thirst for
                     knowledge is matched only by his thirst for blood. But let us not digress. Allow me 
                     to guide you through a few key moments in history that have most profoundly shaped 
                     the world of horror cinema. Master Dracula, with his unparalleled longevity, has
                      observed all these events with great interest.

            <div class="col-md-12 texthistorical1">
                <p> Now, we begin with something quite recent pandemics. Here you can see that there is but one 
                    significant year, 2009, the year of the Swine flu pandemic. It was the third recent outbreak 
                    involving the H1N1 virus, a strain my master, Dracula, has followed closely. The number of 
                    affected individuals was staggering, potentially 700 million to 1.4 billion, accounting for
                     11% to 21% of the global population. A notable statistic indeed. Dracula, ever observant, 
                     was intrigued by the widespread panic and how it affected human behavior. Fascinating, isn’t 
                     it? However, much to his chagrin, the more recent COVID-19 pandemic did not show a significant
                      peak in our analysis, as our data only goes up until 2023. Still, it remains the second
                      deadliest pandemic since the 1960s, which I am certain Dracula would have found quite 
                      interesting, had it been included.
                    Interestingly, the deadliest pandemic of them all, the HIV/AIDS crisis, was not represented 
                    in the plot. The reason? It has never ceased spreading since the 1960s, which, I must say, 
                    gives it a somewhat continuous presence in the history of fear. A fitting parallel to my master’s
                     own existence, don't you think?

            <div class="col-md-12 texthistorical2">
                <p> Moving on, my dear guest, to the petrol crisis. Dracula has always been fascinated 
                    by the global implications of crises like these, especially when they affect the world’s
                     economy.

            <div class="col-md-12 texthistorical22">
                <p> We see that the global financial crisis in 2008 is the only event significant at 5%. 
                    It marked a sharp rise and fall in oil prices, which directly influenced the film industry.
                     In fact, Dracula noticed, as I too have observed, that the price of a barrel of oil soared
                      to $147 in July 2008, only to plummet to $32 by December.
                    But here’s the most curious part—2008 is the only year between 1995 and 2020 where we see 
                    a decrease in the total number of horror films produced. This, my dear guest, was a direct 
                    consequence of the global economic downturn. With consumer spending plummeting, financing 
                    for films dried up, and audiences began to shift their attention elsewhere. Dracula, with
                     his keen understanding of human psychology, could not ignore the impact such a crisis would
                      have on the art of fear.
                    In 1973, when the first oil crisis struck, the OAPEC imposed an embargo, and the price of 
                    oil skyrocketed by 300%. It is perhaps no surprise that this event also affected the lexicon
                     of horror films, with terms related to economic turmoil becoming more prominent in the 
                     genre's summaries. Master Dracula, ever the strategist, would likely say that such events
                      opened new doors for darker stories to emerge.

                <p> The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 stands out, with the highest peak in influence over
                     the entire time period, appearing two years after the event. It perfectly aligns with 
                     Dracula's observations about how time—especially when dealing with something other than 
                     sudden crises—shapes human fear. 

                    For my master, Dracula, the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the end of an era, and 
                    indeed, the horror genre reflected this transformation. The lexicon of horror films 
                    shifted dramatically, with communist themes becoming less prevalent. Dracula, with his 
                    endless years of experience, would have noted this shift keenly, as the world moved away 
                    from fears of communism and embraced new monsters, both human and supernatural.
                    And yet, in 1991, the Berlin Wall’s fall left its indelible mark on cinema, with an 
                    abrupt spike in horror films reflecting the anxiety and uncertainty of the time. The 
                    Cuban-American Thaw in the following years also influenced horror film summaries, though 
                    more subtly. Dracula often muses on the ever-evolving nature of human fears, and how 
                    they shift from one terror to the next. He would say that the fear of communism has all 
                    but faded now, much like the fear of vampires in the modern world.
                    
                    I hope these insights into history's influence on horror cinema have intrigued you, 
                    my dear guest. As for Dracula, he remains ever passionate in his study of fear, though
                     I must warn you, his moods can be... unsettling at times.
