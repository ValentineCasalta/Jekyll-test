                        <p> Ah, yes, this is a fascinating one to start with. A graph that shows not just the rise of cinema in general, but the peculiar rise of horror films. Do you see these peaks? Very interesting, indeed. But let me explain.
                            As you can see, the overall number of films has been on the up-and-up since the last century—no surprise there, as humanity loves its distractions, especially after a long day of... well, you know, surviving in this chaotic world.
                            Now, what you’ll notice is a very strong surge after the 90s, particularly in the realm of horror films. It's almost as if the genre is... feeding off something deeper in society. But let’s break it down a bit further, shall we?
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-md-12 text-content3">
                        <p> Take a look at the first spike: the early 70s, a time period marked by social unrest—Vietnam, civil rights movements, a world in turmoil. People turned to horror films to confront their fears about a changing world. Horror, you see, always mirrors society’s anxieties.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p> 
                            Now, in the late 80s to early 90s, the Cold War was ending, but tension still hung in the air. Films played on the fear of the unknown, and slasher films reflected anxieties about a collapsing societal order.
                            And then, from 2002 to 2019, we see a massive rise in horror films, coinciding with the War on Terror, the 2008 economic crash, and general uncertainty. People sought comfort in films tapping into collective dread about a chaotic, post-apocalyptic world.
                            Dracula, ever the observer of human nature, has seen these patterns unfold for centuries. Horror films are more than entertainment—they're a reflection of our deepest fears. And that, my dear visitor, is why Dracula is so fascinated by them.

                        <p> Ah, dear visitor, take a moment to behold this map—an illustration of horror’s reach across the globe. Now, before we delve deeper, tell me… where are you from? Your homeland must certainly have its own brand of terror, yes?
                            Notice the size of the circles? The larger they are, the more horror films have been produced in that region. It seems the western world—especially the United States—has been a dominant force in creating such unspeakable horrors.
                            But, of course, that’s no surprise. Hollywood has always had a particular fondness for things that go bump in the night. "Then we have Europe. Germany, France, Italy... these places too are steeped in a rich history of horror. It’s interesting, though. Some regions are a little... underrepresented, aren’t they? The east is still finding its footing in the world of cinematic terror."
Horror is certainly a global phenomenon, but as you can see, some areas are just beginning to indulge in the genre. There’s something almost chilling about seeing these areas slowly waking up to the world of fear and dread, don’t you think?
