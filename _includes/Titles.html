                <p> Before you lies a fascinating visualization, dear visitor—a breakdown of the popularity of monstrous 
                    creatures over the decades, as reflected in the titles of horror films. Once upon a time, in the early days of horror, ghosts ruled supreme.
                    Mysterious, intangible, and steeped in folklore—they were the darlings of terror. But alas, as humanity 
                    grew bolder, more... material fears began to take hold. And finally, in the 50’s, our Master claims his 
                    rightful place! The vampire, elegant and eternal, rose to dominate the decade. Soon,
                     audiences grew distracted by new horrors—aliens, zombies, even clowns. Yes, clowns! Can you imagine 
                     anything so… undignified?

            <div class="col-md-12 texttitles11">
                <p>    And then, of course, we have the witches—always lurking, always waiting for their moment in the shadows.
                    And the aliens, with their cold, otherworldly menace. Both fascinating competitors, though I dare say 
                    they lack the allure of a finely tailored cape and a Transylvanian accent.
                   Ah, but here lies the true challenge of our time: the zombie. From the 1990s onward, these shambling, 
                   brainless husks became the face of horror. Why? Perhaps because they reflect the fears of the modern 
                   world—pandemics, overpopulation, the loss of individuality. But where is the grace, the sophistication? 
                   Such crude creatures, don’t you think?

                <p> Now, between you and me, Dracula does not take kindly to this chart. To think that 
                    his kind—the aristocrats of horror—must share the stage with these upstarts? It’s enough 
                    to make him… well, bite.
                    What’s your favorite killer like? The language we use 
                    to describe our predators tells us so much about our deepest fears. Let’s take a closer 
                    look, shall we?
                    As the decades pass, the word killer rises to dominance. There’s a steady progression in its prominence, 
                    especially in the 70s. By the 90s, it peaks—unsurprising, really. The world was gripped by the sensation 
                    of slasher films, and everyone, it seemed, had a killer in their sights.
                    But then—ah, how the mighty fall. By the late 90s and 2000s, killer starts to fade in favor of other 
                    descriptors. A shift, perhaps, toward the more nuanced and sophisticated killer? Enter the serial killer, 
                    a term that climbs during the 80s and becomes iconic in the 90s and 2000s. 
                    A killer with method and madness! 
                </p>
            </div>    
            
            <div class="col-md-12 texttitles22">
                <p> My master Dracula is, of course, no stranger to serial behavior—though I’d say his taste 
                    is far more... refined.
                    And then we see the slow rise of the stalker, a term that peaks in the 2020s. It seems the world’s 
                    fears have evolved. It’s not just the killer who lurks in the shadows now—it’s the stalker, watching, 
                    waiting, obsessing. Perhaps a reflection of the growing sense of paranoia in our connected world, where
                     privacy is no longer a given. 
                    But there’s one term that really stands out, isn't there? Predator. In the 80s, a new breed of killer emerges—predators.
                     How fitting for Dracula, don’t you think? A predator in the truest sense, hunting with cold, calculating precision. 
                    Finally, the butcher. A bit of an outlier, don’t you think? It peaks early in the 60s and 70s, then fades away into 
                    obscurity. Perhaps people grew tired of the brute force—looking for something a little more... elegant.
                    So, what do you think, my dear guest? Which killer appeals most to your taste? It seems the world’s idea of horror 
                    killers has evolved... perhaps in ways even Dracula did not anticipate.

                <p> Well, well, well. It seems horror films don’t just show us the terrors lurking in the 
                    shadows—they also reveal just how bizarre and twisted our desires can be. As you can 
                    see from this chart, the word love has consistently reigned supreme in horror film titles, 
                    almost always at the top of the list. A rather curious choice, wouldn’t you say? Perhaps it’s
                    not the love we think of—no, no. In horror, love is often forbidden, twisted, or downright 
                    dangerous.
                    Then we see desire making a strong presence, particularly in the 1950s. Could it be that 
                    post-war anxieties manifested in such yearnings? Sexy takes a turn around the 1970s, and 
                    by the 1990s, erotic surfaces—how charming. A shift towards more explicit themes, perhaps
                    reflecting a society growing more... liberated in its darkest fantasies?
                    As always, horror mirrors our strange and unsettling nature. It’s clear that, when it comes
                    to the things that lurk in our minds, we’re not just afraid—we’re drawn to the bizarre, the
                    taboo, the forbidden.

                <p> Ah, welcome to the most charming corner of the Hall of Titles. Here we delve into the most 
                    recurrent words associated with the word KILLER in movie titles. And let me tell you, it’s 
                    a delightful menagerie of the strange and the bizarre…
                    First off, we see the expected – serial, of course, because what’s a killer without a little
                    pattern of madness? But then we have crocodile. Yes, that’s right – a killer crocodile. And 
                    clown – oh, of course. Who else would we trust to bring joy to our nightmares?
                    And look! Driller – because nothing says horror like a killer with a power tool. And let’s 
                    not forget mutant, fire, bees and shrews… Seriously, who decided that shews should be 
                    murderers? I mean, bees are terrifying enough, but shrews? The more you know…
    Also, I can't ignore the nerd and star in the mix—because what better way to turn a geek into a killer than 
    by putting him in a slasher film? The range here is truly impressive. From cannibal to Barby, it seems the
    only thing scarier than a killer is... well, whatever Barby could possibly be doing here.
    It’s truly a carnival of absurdity—just the way horror should be!

            <div class="col-md-12 texttitles5">
                <p> Ah, now we’re entering an intriguing comparison —the GIRL and BOY in horror movie titles. 
                    Let’s compare them, shall we? You’ll find that there’s a fascinating distinction in how these
                     two are portrayed, and the words associated with them reveal quite a lot about the genre’s 
                     treatment of gender.
                    For the girl, we see words like zombie, dead, school, murder, and chainsaw. Her world is one 
                    filled with danger, death, and the supernatural. There’s an overwhelming focus on things that
                     threaten her—whether it's the undead, murderers, or a world gone wrong (hell, machine).                
                </p>
            </div>  

            <div class="col-md-12 texttitles52">
                <p> There’s a sense of victimhood here, and little plays a big part—this seems to suggest an 
                     image of innocence, perhaps before it is destroyed by the horrors she encounters. Notice 
                     also the mention of daddy's and snake, which indicate twisted relationships and a touch of 
                     dangerous sexuality lurking beneath the surface.
                    Now, the boy—oh, he’s got a different tale to tell. Words like monkey, incest, lover, pretty,
                     sick, and stone paint a much stranger and more psychological picture. The boy’s journey seems 
                     filled with confusion, desire, and bizarre scenarios. There’s a distinct lack of pure danger 
                     like the girl’s—no zombies or chainsaws for him. Instead, the themes are more personal and
                      often disturbing (incest, lover, loneliest). He’s dealing with more intimate, even 
                      grotesque, fears and desires.
                    The contrast is clear: the girl’s world is dominated by external threats—monsters, death, and 
                    the uncontrollable. She’s often a victim of her circumstances. Meanwhile, the boy appears 
                    trapped in a world of more internal struggles and strange encounters—his fears seem less about 
                    physical harm and more about psychological or societal taboos. While the girl faces the horrors 
                    of the world, the boy is tangled up in personal and disturbing themes. This difference speaks
                     volumes about how horror reflects not just fear, but gender itself.
                    Would you agree, my dear visitor? It’s quite the reflection of how society’s views of gender 
                    creep into the shadows of horror films.

                <p> Ah, now we come to an absolutely fascinating graph, one that reveals the most recurrent
                     words associated with the word VAMPIRE in movie titles. My master... His presence, his immortality, his eternal 
                     power—these are things that no mere movie title can truly capture. 
                    Hunter stands out, naturally—Dracula, of course, has dealt with many hunters over the 
                    centuries, but he always stays one step ahead. The words woman and mr. are classic, 
                    speaking to the allure and mystery of my master. Lesbian appears too, which, I must 
                    admit, Dracula would find quite charming, given his refined taste for strong, powerful 
                    women.
                    Then we venture into more curious territory. Vegan vampires? Dracula would certainly 
                    scoff at that. As for assassin and samurai—a bit more action-packed than the grand, 
                    dignified elegance my master prefers, but they do add some flair, I suppose.
                    City and conspiracy now replace the old castles, indicating that modern vampires are 
                    tangled in urban plots. But for Dracula? His mansion will always be the true seat of
                     power. Lastly, the words last, living, and first reflect the eternal question of
                      immortality—one my master has known for centuries.
