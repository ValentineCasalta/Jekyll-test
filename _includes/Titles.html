                <p> Ah, welcome, dear visitor, to the Hall of Titles. Here lies the very essence of horror, distilled into the words that beckon audiences to face their fears. This is where we dissect the linguistic anatomy of terror.

                <p> Before you lies a fascinating visualization, dear visitor—a breakdown of the popularity of monstrous 
                    creatures over the decades, as reflected in the titles of horror films.Here we see the rise and fall of 
                    the great creatures that have haunted humanity's dreams.Once upon a time, in the early days of horror, ghosts ruled supreme.
                    Mysterious, intangible, and steeped in folklore—they were the darlings of terror. But alas, as humanity 
                    grew bolder, more... material fears began to take hold.And finally, in the 50’s, our Master claims his 
                    rightful place! The vampire, elegant and eternal, rose to dominate the decade. Surely you’ve heard of a 
                    certain Dracula who contributed to this surge, no? Yet… as you can see, this dominance was fleeting. Soon,
                     audiences grew distracted by new horrors—aliens, zombies, even clowns. Yes, clowns! Can you imagine 
                     anything so… undignified?

            <div class="col-md-12 text11">
                <p>    And then, of course, we have the witches—always lurking, always waiting for their moment in the shadows.
                    And the aliens, with their cold, otherworldly menace. Both fascinating competitors, though I dare say 
                    they lack the allure of a finely tailored cape and a Transylvanian accent.
                   Ah, but here lies the true challenge of our time: the zombie. From the 1990s onward, these shambling, 
                   brainless husks became the face of horror. Why? Perhaps because they reflect the fears of the modern 
                   world—pandemics, overpopulation, the loss of individuality. But where is the grace, the sophistication? 
                   Such crude creatures, don’t you think?
